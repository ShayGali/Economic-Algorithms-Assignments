        source: Any,
        target: Any,
) -> Tuple[List[Any], float, Dict[Tuple[Any, Any], float]]:
    """
    Compute the shortest path from `source` to `target` (by `weight_attr`)
    and the VCG payment owed by every edge on that path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.Graph or nx.Graph
        Weighted graph whose edge weights are stored in the `weight_attr`
        edge attribute.
    source, target : hashable
        Start and goal vertices.
    weight_attr : str, optional
        Name of the edge attribute that stores the cost/weight (default "weight").

    Returns
    -------
    path : list
        The sequence of vertices on the minimum-cost path.
    total_cost : float
        Sum of edge weights along `path`.
    payments : dict
        Mapping {(u, v): p_e} giving each edge's VCG payment.
        Keys use the same orientation as the path (for undirected graphs you
        may wish to sort each tuple yourself).

    Raises
    ------
    networkx.NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between `source` and `target`.

        Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G1 = nx.Graph()
    >>> G1.add_edge("a", "b", weight=3)
    >>> G1.add_edge("a", "c", weight=5)
    >>> G1.add_edge("a", "d", weight=10)
    >>> G1.add_edge("b", "c", weight=1)
    >>> G1.add_edge("b", "d", weight=4)
    >>> G1.add_edge("c", "d", weight=1)
    >>> path, cost, payments = vcg_shortest_path_payments(G1, "a", "d")
    >>> path
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    >>> cost
    5
    >>> payments == {('a', 'b'): 4, ('b', 'c'): 2, ('c', 'd'): 3}
    True

    Another example with a directed graph:
    >>> G2 = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G2.add_edge("s", "v", weight=2)
    >>> G2.add_edge("v", "t", weight=3)
    >>> G2.add_edge("s", "t", weight=6)
    >>> path, cost, pay = vcg_shortest_path_payments(G2, "s", "t")
    >>> path
    ['s', 'v', 't']
    >>> cost
    5
    >>> pay == {('s', 'v'): 3, ('v', 't'): 4}
